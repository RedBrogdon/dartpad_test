# DartPad test packages

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/RedBrogdon/dartpad_test.svg?branch=master)

This repo contains two packages designed for use in exercises running
[DartPad](https://dartpad.dev). If you're not constructing codelabs or other
learning resources that use DartPad, they probably won't be of much interest to
you.
